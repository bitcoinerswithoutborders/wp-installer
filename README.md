wp-installer
============

This is our wordpress install repository.

Some of the repositories this repository has as submodules are not public (yet).

Contact dev@bwb.is if you should have access but have not.

installation instructions:

    git clone git@github.com:bitcoinerswithoutborders/wp-installer
    cd wp-installer
    make install


this will:

git clone git@github.com:bitcoinerswithoutborders/wp

add all needed plugins and themes as submodules or via wget, 
and git submodule update --init them.


make will just update the environment each time you call it.
